Logic - Try to add all the divisors or you can say the multiple of i;
At first we will try to create vector and assign 1 initially, 
then we will traverse from 2 to N and try to add multiples of i let's say N=4 
so in first iteration i=2 and then j=2 , divisor[2] = divisor[2] + 2;
=> divisor[2]= 1(initially it was 1) + 2 so it becomes 3 which means 1 or 2 are the
factors of 2 and after doing summation we get. Same we do for rest of the number as well.
